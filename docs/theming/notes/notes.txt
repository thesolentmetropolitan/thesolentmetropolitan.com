is it ok to have heading text that itself doesnt have a link in a menu accessibility

Yes, it is acceptable to have heading text that is not a link in a menu from an accessibility standpoint. Such items are often used as labels or categories to group related, clickable menu items beneath them, especially in a mega menu structure. 
Key Accessibility Considerations
Semantic Markup: The heading must use proper semantic HTML heading tags (<h2>, <h3>, etc.) so that screen readers recognize it as a heading. Do not use styling (like bold or large font) alone to create the visual appearance of a heading.
Differentiation: There must be a clear distinction between what is clickable (a link) and what is not (a non-linked heading).
Visual cues: Linked items should have standard link conventions, such as being underlined or a different color.
Assistive technology cues: Screen reader users will naturally perceive the difference due to the semantic markup (a heading versus a link).
Logical Structure: The headings should follow a logical, hierarchical order within the page structure (e.g., <h2> followed by <h3>s, not skipping levels like <h2> straight to <h4>). In fixed sections like a navigation menu, consistency across pages is more important than the content heading levels on any single page.
Keyboard Navigation: Non-linked headings should not be in the keyboard tab order, as they are not interactive elements. Only interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) should be keyboard focusable.
Context: Headings help users, especially those using screen readers, to scan and navigate the menu by section, significantly improving usability. 
By following these practices, you can effectively use non-linked headings in menus to provide valuable structure and context without creating accessibility barriers.
