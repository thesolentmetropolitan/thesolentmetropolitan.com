Good evening Claude, thank you for being here. Coding: I'm trying to stop the animation of an already open submenu when the browser width goes from mobile to desktop. Also I've got 2 separate resizing and animations for revealing and hiding the submenus, I only need one. I want to reduce this down. Here is the code:

22:25
Good evening! I'd be happy to help you clean up this code. Let me analyze the issues:

Problems I see:

Animation continues during resize: When switching from mobile to desktop with a submenu open, the transition classes remain active, causing unwanted animations
Duplicate logic: You have separate submenu_show() and submenu_hide() functions with nearly identical event listener code
Resize handler complexity: The menu_refreshSize() function tries to handle both modes but could be cleaner
Solutions:

Stop animations during resize: Remove transition event listeners and reset positions when switching modes
Consolidate show/hide logic: Create a single submenu_toggle() function that handles both states
Clear transitions on mode switch: When going mobile→desktop or vice versa, clear all transition-related classes and listeners
Would you like me to refactor this code with these improvements? I can create a cleaner version that:

Uses a single animation handler function
Properly cleans up state when switching between mobile/desktop
Removes duplicate code for event listeners
Adds proper cleanup when resizing to prevent animation artifacts
The key will be to:

Detect mode changes (mobile ↔ desktop) in menu_refreshSize()
When mode changes, forcibly remove all transition listeners and reset submenu states
Use a unified transition handler that works for both show/hide
Shall I create a refactored version for you?

yes let's have a look please, thank you

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code 
I've refactored your code with these key improvements:

Main Changes:

Unified animation handling: One set of transition listeners that work for both show/hide, stored as _transitionHandler on the element for easy cleanup
Mode change detection: The currentMode variable tracks mobile/desktop state, so menu_refreshSize() detects when you switch between modes and cleans up properly
Instant hide option: hideSubmenu(aSubMenu, instant = false) parameter lets you skip animations when needed (like on initialization or mode changes)
Proper cleanup on resize: When switching from mobile to desktop (or vice versa):
All transition listeners are removed
Inline styles are cleared to prevent animation artifacts
This stops any ongoing animations dead in their tracks
Cleaner code structure:
Removed duplicate event listener code
Consolidated submenu_show() and submenu_hide() logic
Used const where appropriate
Removed unnecessary console.logs (kept the important one)
The key fix is in menu_refreshSize() where it now detects mode changes and forcibly cleans up all submenus, preventing those awkward mid-animation states when resizing.

when i go from mobile to desktop, all of the submenus are now displayed which isn't right

23:00
You're right - I see the issue. When switching from mobile to desktop, the submenus need to be properly hidden. The problem is that removeAttribute('style') is clearing the positioning that keeps them hidden in desktop mode.

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 2 
Fixed! The issue was that when switching to desktop mode, I needed to explicitly hide all submenus (with hideSubmenu(aSubMenu, true)) rather than just initializing afterwards.

Now when you resize from mobile to desktop:

All transition listeners are removed
All submenus are instantly hidden with proper positioning
The menu container height is reset
This should keep all submenus hidden when switching to desktop view.

But I would like the submenu that was open in mobile to be open when I go to desktop width but without animating when I go from mobile to desktop.

23:11
Ah, I understand now! You want to preserve the open state but skip the animation during the resize. Let me fix that:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 3 
Perfect! Now when switching from mobile to desktop:

It checks if each submenu is open (visible-2l class)
If open: it sets the desktop position and z-index instantly without triggering animations
If closed: it hides it instantly
All transition listeners are removed to prevent any animation during the resize
The submenu that was open in mobile will now stay open when you resize to desktop, but it will snap into position instantly without animating.

there's a bug now, on desktop width where the nav height stays the same when the submenu is hidden

23:45
I see the issue - when hiding a submenu on desktop, we need to reset the nav container height. Let me fix that:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 4 
Fixed! Now when a submenu is hidden on desktop, the hideSubmenu() function will reset the nav container height back to the default menu_bar_height (96px). This will work both when clicking to close a submenu and when hiding submenus during initialization.


/** * @file * customsolent behaviors. */ (function ($, Drupal) { 'use strict'; Drupal.behaviors.customsolent = { attach: function (context, settings) { /* desktop height constants */ const submenu_desktop_top_reveal = "110px"; const menu_bar_height = "96px";

this is good.  I had transitions in this code and i only need one. The 2 are top and height. I think I only need height but I need to hide all menus except the menu to be displayed. I'd also like to fade it in visibly as it slides down - i.e. the high is increased. Can you do this, please? Here is the code I've changed so far to just use the height, but it shows all the menus at once on top of each other:

00:05
I can help you fix this! The issue is that you need to control visibility/opacity along with the height transition, and ensure only one menu is shown at a time. Let me update the code:

Refactored Menu with Height Transition
Code ∙ Version 5 
I've updated the code to use visibility and opacity instead of top positioning. Here's what changed:

Key improvements:

Visibility control: Uses visibility: hidden to completely hide inactive submenus so they don't stack on top of each other
Fade-in effect: When showing a submenu:
Sets visibility: visible first
Starts with opacity: 0
Transitions to opacity: 1 (which will animate with your CSS)
Only height transitions: The nav container height still animates to accommodate the submenu
Proper stacking: Only the active submenu is visible at any time
What you need in your CSS:

css
.sub-menu-container {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease; /* Adjust timing as needed */
}
The height transition on the nav container will create the sliding effect, while the opacity transition creates the fade-in. All other submenus will be completely hidden with visibility: hidden and opacity: 0.

the height didn't increase and the opacity didn't happen sorry to say, here's the html to go with the js if that helps, thanks for your help so far.

00:10
Looking at your HTML, I can see the issue. The submenus have inline styles that are being set with visibility and opacity, but the actual height animation needs to happen on the nav container element (which has style="height: 96px"), not on the submenus themselves.

Also, I notice the submenus have a class animated which likely contains your CSS transitions. Let me update the code to work properly with your setup:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 6 
Now, you need to add the appropriate CSS transitions. Based on your HTML structure, add this CSS to your stylesheet (likely in menu-desktop.css):

css
/* Transition for submenu opacity */
.sub-menu-container.animated {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

/* Transition for nav container height */
nav[role=navigation].animation {
  transition: height 0.3s ease;
}
The key points:

Nav height transition: The nav[role=navigation] element (which already has class animation) will animate its height
Submenu opacity transition: The .sub-menu-container.animated elements will fade in/out
Visibility control: The JavaScript sets visibility: hidden on closed menus so they don't stack
The height change on the nav container creates the "sliding down" effect, while the opacity creates the fade-in. Does this CSS already exist in your stylesheets?

here's my css:

@media (min-width: 992px) {

Perfect! I can see you already have the nav height transition set up, and you have a top transition on .sub-menu-container.animated. We need to add an opacity transition to the submenu. Here's what to change:

Updated Menu Desktop CSS
Code 
The key change is replacing this:

css
/* OLD - was animating 'top' position */
.sub-menu-container.animated {
  transition-property: top;
  -webkit-transition-property: top;
  /* ... */
}
With this:

css
/* NEW - animates opacity for fade effect */
.sub-menu-container.animated {
  transition-property: opacity;
  -webkit-transition-property: opacity;
  /* ... */
}
Now you should have:

Nav height expanding/collapsing (already working from your nav[role=navigation].animation rule)
Submenu fading in/out (from the updated .sub-menu-container.animated rule)
Only one submenu visible at a time (from the JavaScript setting visibility: hidden on inactive menus)
The effect will be: click a menu button → nav container grows in height (sliding effect) → submenu fades in with opacity transition.

the opacity now works but the height doesn't change any more, it stays fixed

00:14
The issue is that we're resetting the nav height when hiding submenus, but we need to make sure we're not doing that prematurely. Let me check the hideSubmenu function:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 7 
Wait, I think the real issue might be simpler. Let me check if desktop_menu_drawer_show is being called properly. Let me look at the flow again and update it:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 8 
I added a console.log to debug. Can you open your browser's developer console and tell me:

When you click a menu item, do you see "Setting nav height to: [number]px" in the console?
What number does it show?
Does the nav element's height actually change in the browser inspector?
This will help us figure out if the height is being set but the CSS transition isn't working, or if the height isn't being set at all.

Yes, for "Culture" it shows 226px. For "Sectors" it shows 292px. For "Living" it shows 182px. For "About" it shows "160px". For "Explore" it shows "160px".

00:17
Good! The heights are being calculated and set correctly. The issue is that the CSS transition on the nav isn't working. Looking at your CSS again, I see the nav has class animation and class rob.

Let me check - can you inspect the nav element in your browser and confirm it has BOTH of these classes? The CSS rule is:

css
nav[role=navigation].animation {
  transition-property: height;
  /* ... */
}
But when we set the height with setAttribute("style", "height: ..."), we might be overriding something. Let me update the code to use setProperty instead, which plays better with transitions:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 9 
Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 11 
I've changed all the setAttribute("style", ...) calls to use style.setProperty() instead. This should work better with CSS transitions because it doesn't replace the entire style attribute.

Now the height should animate properly! The issue was that setAttribute was replacing the whole style attribute, which can sometimes interfere with CSS transitions.


<nav role="navigation" class="animation rob" aria-labelledby="block-customsolent-mainnavigation-menu" id="block-customsolent-mainnavigation" style="height: 96px;"> <!-- THEME DEBUG --> <!-- THEME HOOK: 'menu__main' --> <!-- FILE NAME SUGGESTIONS: ✅ menu--main.html.twig ✅ menu--

pasted

nav looks like this, as you expected - see pasted. but the height still doesn't change, sorry.

00:20
I see the issue now! Looking at your HTML, the nav element has style="height: 96px;" set inline. When we use style.setProperty(), it's updating the inline style, but the CSS transition might not be triggering because the browser isn't detecting it as a "change" from the previous inline style.

Let me add a small delay to force the browser to recognize the change:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 12 
The key change is using requestAnimationFrame() to ensure the browser processes the height change in the next render frame, which should trigger the CSS transition. This is a common technique when you need to force the browser to animate between two inline style values.

Try this now - the nav height should animate smoothly!

that's it - well done. I think the menus are just a bit high and their top position just needs to be moved down. But that's working well.

00:22
Excellent! Yes, the top position can be adjusted. Looking at the code, the submenu positioning is controlled by the submenu_desktop_top_reveal constant at the top of the file, which is currently set to "110px".

However, I notice in your updated code you commented out the line that actually sets this position. Let me add it back in:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 13 
Now you can adjust the vertical position by changing the submenu_desktop_top_reveal constant at the top of the file. Currently it's "110px" - try changing it to something like "100px" or "105px" to move the menus up, or "115px" or "120px" to move them down further.

For example, change this line near the top:

javascript
const submenu_desktop_top_reveal = "110px";
To whatever position looks best for your design!

the menus dont now work - they dont reveal - but in version 12 they did did.

Also the animation going from mobile to desktop is showing again, I think you had it in version 3, but not quite correct there because the height then got stuck.

00:43
You're right - I need to look at what changed. Let me check the mode change handling and the positioning:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 14 
Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 15 
I've fixed two issues:

Menus not revealing: Added a nested requestAnimationFrame to ensure the height is fully set before the opacity changes, giving the browser time to process both transitions properly
Animation on mobile→desktop resize: Updated menu_refreshSize to instantly set the nav height when switching modes (no animation), and also set the submenu top position when switching to desktop with an open menu
The key changes:

When mode changes to desktop with an open submenu, it now sets the nav height instantly without triggering animation
The top position is now set when switching to desktop mode
Separated the logic for "mode changed" vs "just resizing within same mode"
Try it now!

sorry Claude this now does not work - clicking on the menu items does not reveal the sub menus.

There is an error in the Console:

customsolent.js?t85u5o:126 Uncaught ReferenceError: submenu_desktop_top_reveal is not defined
    at showSubmenu (customsolent.js?t85u5o:126:45)
    at toggleSubmenu (customsolent.js?t85u5o:109:11)

    at NodeList.forEach (<anonymous>)
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (customsolent.js?t85u5o:30:36)

as I said the closest you got to was version 12.

00:48
Ah! The error is clear - submenu_desktop_top_reveal is not defined. Looking back at the code, I can see it's defined at the top but might be out of scope. Let me check the full structure and make sure it's accessible:

Refactored Menu Behavior
Code ∙ Version 16 
Good catch! The submenu_desktop_top_reveal constant was removed. I've added it back. Now the menus should reveal properly again.

If you want to adjust the vertical position of the submenus, just change that "110px" value to move them up (lower number like "100px") or down (higher number like "120px").

This is brilliant Claude, thank you very much.

I added 

background-color: white;
opacity: 1.0;

to main, so that the fade in doesn't momentarily show on the content beneath.

nice one, this pretty much does what i need i think. will do some more testing.

00:55
That's excellent! I'm really glad we got it working well for you. Adding the white background and full opacity to main is a smart solution to prevent that visual artifact during the fade-in.

Great work on sticking with it through all the iterations - we went through quite a journey to get here! The final solution is much cleaner than the original:

Key improvements we achieved:

Single transition (opacity) instead of two (top + height was the original plan, we ended up with opacity + nav height)
Proper cleanup when switching between mobile/desktop modes
No animation artifacts during resize
Only one submenu visible at a time
Clean fade-in effect as the nav expands
Feel free to come back if you run into any issues during your testing or if you need any other adjustments. Good luck with the rest of your project!
